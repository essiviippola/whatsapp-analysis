# Whatsapp analysis

The scripts on this repository can be used to extract statistics from Whatsapp group chats as well generate text based on Whatsapp messages. The main application was to analyze messages to celebrate our group chat's ("Tuuli Nousee") 4th anniversary.

## Dataset

Data comprise of a CSV file of messages exported from Whatsapp. Each row represents one message. Messages are written primarily in Finnish with some English here and there.

The data contains the following fields:

Variable | Description
--- | ---
Datetime | Date and time in the following format: D.M.YYYY klo hh.mm
Author | The name of the author
Message | The contents of the message or the phrase "<Media jätettiin pois>" in case of a media message

The following variables were derived from the above source data:

Variable | Type | Description
--- | --- | ---
date | datetime | Message date
time | char | Message time
author | char | Message author
message | char | Message contents
message_count | num | Always 1 because each row contains one message. Used for aggregation.
media_count | num | Number of media attached to the message
letter_count | num | Number of letters in the message
word_count | num | Number of words in the message
message_with_emoji | bool | Indicator for messages with at least one emoji
link | list | List of links in the message
link_count | num | Number of links in the message
message_with_link | bool | Indicator for messages with at least one link
weekday | char | Weekday of the message in English
weekend | bool | Indicator for messages sent on a weekend
hour | num | Hour when the message was sent
hour_group | char | Hour group, split by 6 hours

## Analysis

The analysis contains the following sections:

- Messages by author
- Messages by date and time
- Emojis
- Links
- Message contents

## Text generation

The final goal is to build a chatbot generating answers like the ones typically sent in out group chat.

The first attempt at text generation uses an *LSTM recurrent neural network* to generate text character-by-characted based on an input of 100 characters. The output does not make  much sense but the model was able to learn some characteristics of spoken Finnish.

```
Seed: "n maksaa softapivitykset? 0e huollon yhteydess no sit 5/5 iha jees toki huolto oli 169e mut ei ny ka"
Result: "ikki tarvii kaikki tiet et se on koko tietoturvaittu kaikki tiet et se on kyll tiet et se on koko si"
```

The second attempt uses *Markov chains* with back-off to generate text word-by-word. Word-by-word generation works seemingly better but is not much better than a 'bag of words' approach. The model can only use words present in the training data.

```
Seed: "mitä tehdään lauantaina"
Result: "käydä kyselemässä että opin elämästä kun 2/9 * oblivion music television näky, mut ens viikon perjantaina 
saadaan ihmiset pelkää mikroja😃 Tää puukoriste on kai virallinen asiointikieli on semmonen autossa ja luot yhteyden 
ottamisest apreeseensissä eikä edes teamssii pyytäny jälkikäteen usb voi ydinvoimalais ni sitten just nyt luet siellä 
kermaviiliämpäreitä ?"
```

## Ideas for the next steps

- Using a pretrained neural network (maybe FinBERT if possible)
- Utilizing the chat-format of the training data (as the final goal is to generate whatsapp message type texts)
